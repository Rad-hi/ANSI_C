# Next step in learning C after the book, *Data Structures* ...

I will be following this [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IEJIKnBJjFiudyP6wSXmykrn67Ykqib): [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IEJIKnBJjFiudyP6wSXmykrn67Ykqib](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IEJIKnBJjFiudyP6wSXmykrn67Ykqib) by [Jacob Sorber](https://www.youtube.com/c/JacobSorber).

I am familiar with the concepts of the data structures covered in this series, but never set down and implemented all of them for the sake of implementing it, so I'll be going through them all and learning more in-depth in each of them.
